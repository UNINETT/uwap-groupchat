This is an application for UNINETT WebApp Park (UWAP). It shows how FEIDE-groups can store messages that are only readable by other members of that group. Users can chat, tweet, share code and images, and use a group-scheduler. The tweet-function shows how UWAP.data.get() can be used with an Oauth1-handler.
